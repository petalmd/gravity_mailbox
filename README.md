# GravityMailbox

Development tools that aim to make it simple to visualize mail sent by your Rails app directly through your Rails app.
It works in development and also in a staging environment by using the `Rails.cache` to store the mails.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'gravity_mailbox'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gravity_mailbox

## Usage

* Config ActionMailer to use the RailsCacheDeliveryMethod.

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :gravity_mailbox_rails_cache
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
```

* Send mails
* Go to http://localhost:3000/gravity_mailbox to see the mails.
